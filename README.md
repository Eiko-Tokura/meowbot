This is a cute qq bot 'MeowMeow' I wrote in haskell owo

It was my first Haskell project and was not well written. But I have now revisited it and heavily refactored, it is now much more modular, maintainable! I also added a lot exciting new features!

## Features
- [x] Chat with you via ChatGPT API
- [x] Send you interesting voices (aokana >w<)
- [x] Generating really good pictures, formulas from Markdown
- [x] Generating Chat output in Markdown and display in pictures
- [x] Generating Random Variables

use ':help' to get more information.

Welcome to contribute and play with MeowMeow!

## Usage

If you want to run it, you need the following files to support the above functions: (otherwise the corresponding functions will not work)

1. create a file 'apiKey' containing the API key of ChatGPT in the root directory of the project.
2. add aokana voice files in ./aokana/voice and script files in ./aokana/scripts

Compile and run it in either ghc, cabal or stack, whatever >w<
